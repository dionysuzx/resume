I'm a passionate software engineer. I started my journey with computers in middle school where I'd take apart the hardware and install Linux distros from scratch; and I did the same with my Android phone, mainly an unlocked Galaxy Nexus. From high school is when I started programming and knew that I'd be doing software.

I search deeply for the right solution to solve a problem (see [my keyboard](https://github.com/dionysuzx/zmk-config)). I believe that it's very easy for an engineer to over-abstract or over-use "design principles", causing tight coupling and unnecessary maintenance in a codebase (because I've made this mistake). I do my best to understand abstraction, and its relationship to coupling/cohesion to make pragmatic decisions that are specific to the problem.

I'm particularly passionate about processes, especially developer processes. This is reflected throughout my entire career and is a topic I'm very passionate to talk about.

I'm still learning every day.

## Education

**Virginia Tech** \
Bachelors of Science, Computer Science \
2017-2020

**Northern Virginia Community College** \
Credits in Math and Computer Science \
2015-2017

Most of my education about Ethereum came from my experience at Taiko Labs.

## Career

### Taiko Labs
**Oct 2022 to Aug 2024** \
Senior Software Engineer + Head of Developer Experience

- Forked ethereum-helm-charts and wrote our entire rollup devops infra in it, today this is used by Nethermind surge rollup (see [here on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/taiko-helm-charts/commit/e0d2bd3203db5f33c621a83d3fa268197cf7cbe8)).
- Did extensive work in the Taiko monorepo, especially around developer tooling and experience. This was not only for internal engineers, but external contributors. Made sure the project was easy to contribute to open source.
- Wrote all the documentation and the documentation framework. I have a ton of experience in the field of documentation.
- Audited smart contracts.
- Did presentations on Taiko architecture / traveled to conferences to speak about Taiko's based rollup architecture.
- Wrote and maintained the main website for a while.
- Helped with the bridge UI (React).

### GameStop Blockchain
**Feb 2022 to Oct 2022** \
Senior Software Engineer

- Backend database scaling with Kubernetes and PostgreSQL. Implemented elastic scaling to deal with spikey traffic (0 req/sec to 350 req/sec in less than a minute). We could've used a managed service but I implemented it in house which saved a lot of money.
- Lots of backend / frontend work. TypeScript backend (Express / Node.js) and React frontend. I wrote a lot of code for both.
- Lots of work on DevOps as well.
- Created an Engineering Handbook for the organization, trained and led engineers on how to do on-call duties. This handbook I created is a source of pride. I developed standard operating procedures to help the engineering organization move more efficiently.
- Created a fun social bonding event for the team called "Fika"; once a week we got together just to drink coffee/tea and chill. :)

### Verisign
**Jun 2020 to Feb 2022** \
Software Engineer

- Standard CRUD app, written in Java spring boot. Learned all the basics of software engineering, code review, testing, and design patterns mainly in the style of OOP (SOLID, DTOs, etc). I've since taken a liking to more of a functional programming style. We used standard stuff: Ansible, Docker, Java, MySQL, Jenkins, React.
- Lots of testing with Selenium and in Java.

### Viasat
**May 2019 to Aug 2019** \
Software Engineering Intern

- Standard CRUD internal tool. Angular, Express, MongoDB (MEAN).

### Carahsoft
**Jul 2018 to Aug 2018** \
Software Engineering Intern

- Standard CRUD internal tool written in C#. My first software gig. Did some JavaScript too.

## Languages/Frameworks

- Very comfortable with Linux/Unix.
- Rust, Typescript, React/Svelte, Python, Java, SQL, Kubernetes, DevOps, GitHub actions, C, C#, AWS/GCP.
- I like to use Rust as my main backend language, Typescript/Svelte as my main frontend, and Python as my main scripting. I pick the tool for the job.
- I'm pretty familiar with DevOps, Kubernetes, and GitHub in general.
- Comfortable with and still learning AI assisted development (Codex / Claude).

## Projects

These are just a few fun projects. The rest of my projects are on my GitHub. My main passion right now is social consensus R&D (see [my talk at DevConnect 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8eqIvihfE)).

- **kittynode**: Run the world computer at home.
- **deep-sentiment**: Accelerate social consensus.
- **dapp-up**: Spin up an Ethereum dapp in one click.
- **eof-polis**: An experiment for aggregating social consensus on EOF.
- **stoa/open-agora**: An experiment with a continuous Polis social feed.
