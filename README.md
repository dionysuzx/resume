I'm a researcher and developer dedicated to improving society with Ethereum.

I started my journey with computers in middle school with hardware and Linux. I search deeply for the right solution to a problem and have learned that it's easy to overengineer, causing unnecessary complexity in a codebase.

I'm particularly interested in developer processes and social coordination.

## Career

### Future Kitty Labs

**Aug 2024 to present** \
Researcher and developer

- Developed Kittynode, a tool for easily running an Ethereum node at home. Written in Rust/Svelte.
- Worked with Taiko Labs on developing the DevOps infra for a new rollup design codenamed Gwyneth.
- Collaborated on a project which applied Polis to social consensus around contentious EIPs such as EOF.
- Co-authored an early specification for applying deep funding to community decision-making.
- Attended Devcon 2024 and Devconnect 2025 to continue deep involvement with Ethereum.
- Gave a [talk at Devconnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8eqIvihfE) about "Making Ethereum Visible".

### Taiko Labs

**Oct 2022 to Aug 2024** \
Senior Software Engineer + Head of Developer Experience

- Forked ethereum-helm-charts and wrote our entire rollup devops infra in it, today this is used by Nethermind surge rollup (see [here on GitHub](https://github.com/NethermindEth/taiko-helm-charts/commit/e0d2bd3203db5f33c621a83d3fa268197cf7cbe8)).
- Improved developer tooling and experience in the Taiko monorepo. This was not only for internal engineers, but external contributors. Made sure the project was easy to contribute to open source.
- Wrote all the documentation and designed the documentation framework.
- Audited smart contracts.
- Did presentations on Taiko architecture / traveled to conferences to speak about Taiko's based rollup architecture.
- Wrote and maintained the main website for a while.
- Fixed bugs and simplified logic in the bridge UI (written in Svelte).

### GameStop Blockchain

**Feb 2022 to Oct 2022** \
Senior Software Engineer

- Backend database scaling with Kubernetes and PostgreSQL. Implemented elastic scaling to deal with spikey traffic (0 req/sec to 350 req/sec in less than a minute). We could've used a managed service but I implemented it in house which saved a lot of money.
- Backend microservice work in TypeScript (Express / Node.js). Frontend UI work in React.
- Wrote core microservice infra with Kubernetes, and much of the CI/CD with GitLab actions.
- Created an Engineering Handbook for the organization, trained and led engineers on how to do on-call duties. I developed standard operating procedures to help the engineering organization move more efficiently. This handbook is a career highlight because I poured my soul into it.
- Created a fun social bonding event for the team called "Fika"; once a week we got together just to drink coffee/tea and chill. :)

### Verisign

**Jun 2020 to Feb 2022** \
Software Engineer

- Standard CRUD app, written in Java spring boot. Learned all the basics of software engineering, code review, testing, and design patterns mainly in the style of OOP (SOLID, DTOs, etc). I've since taken a liking to more of a functional programming style. We used standard stuff: Ansible, Docker, Java, MySQL, Jenkins, React.
- Lots of testing with Selenium and in Java.

### Viasat

**May 2019 to Aug 2019** \
Software Engineering Intern

- Standard CRUD internal tool. Angular, Express, MongoDB (MEAN).

### Carahsoft

**Jul 2018 to Aug 2018** \
Software Engineering Intern

- Standard CRUD internal tool written in C#. My first software gig. Did some JavaScript too.

## Languages/Frameworks

- Rust, TypeScript, React/Svelte, Python, Java, Go, SQL, Kubernetes, DevOps, GitHub actions, C, C#, AWS/GCP.
- I like Rust as my main backend language, TypeScript/Svelte as my main frontend, and Python as my main scripting. I pick the tool for the job.
- Comfortable with Linux/Unix, DevOps, Kubernetes, and GitHub.
- Comfortable with AI assisted development (Codex / Claude).

## Projects

Here are a few projects that best reflect my current focus. The rest of my projects are on [my GitHub](https://github.com/dionysuzx).

- [deep-sentiment](https://github.com/futurekittylabs/deep-sentiment): Early-stage specification designed with Devansh Mehta on how we can apply deep funding to collective decision making. Design iterations and UX are under development.
- [eof-polis](https://github.com/dionysuzx/native-rollups-polis): Designed a website and curated seed comments for a Polis survey designed to educate community members and aggregate sentiment on contentious topics like EOF (collaborators: Josh Davis, Raymond Zhang, Jason Chaskin). We decided to not run the experiment given the sensitive nature of EOF.
- [stoa/open-agora](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-cNXCgs2l-YPSMQq3knCJx81SreO-qzHYrIUstbWQBI/edit?usp=sharing): An experiment to make Ethereum discussions more visible and measurable (collaborators: Josh Davis, Raymond Zhang, Jason Chaskin).
- [kittynode](https://github.com/futurekittylabs/kittynode): Disintermediates control of Ethereum and brings it directly to the user. Easily spin up an Ethereum node and start staking in a few clicks.
